# StakingBonus:calculateBonus wrongly utilizes BPS

Submitted on Mar 10th 2024 at 01:21:12 UTC by @jovi for [Boost | ZeroLend](https://immunefi.com/bounty/zerolend-boost/)

Report ID: #29188

Report type: Smart Contract

Report severity: Insight

Target: https://github.com/zerolend/governance

Impacts:
- Protocol insolvency
- Griefing (e.g. no profit motive for an attacker, but damage to the users or the protocol)

## Description
## Brief/Intro
The calculateBonus function at the StakingBonus contract utilizes BPS in a pattern that may lead to over-accrual of bonuses.

## Vulnerability Details
Basis points (bps) are a common unit of measure for interest rates and other percentages in finance. One basis point is equal to 1/100 of 1%. In decimal form, one basis point appears as 0.0001 (0.01/100)
The usage of basis points is correctly implemented in other parts of the code but not in this one, as it divides the bonusBps variable by 100.

```solidity
function calculateBonus(
        uint256 amount
    ) public view override returns (uint256) {
        uint256 bonus = (amount * bonusBps) / 100;
        // if we don't have enough funds to pay out bonuses, then return 0
        if (zero.balanceOf(address(this)) < bonus) return 0;
        return (amount * bonusBps) / 100;
    }
```

## Impact Details
If the admin decides to set a bonus of 1% then call setBonusBps at the contract, the bonus calculation at the calculateBonus view function will actually return 100%.
The reason for that is it will divide the equivalent of 1% in bps (which is 100) by 100.
This is concerning as any bonus rate over 1% will yield more value in bonuses than in the actual pending amount. It can generate bonuses of up to 100 times the pending amount.

        stakingBonus.setBonusBps(10000);

        bonus = stakingBonus.calculateBonus(1 ether);

        // notice the bonus is 100 times the expected value
        assertEq(bonus, 100 ether);

       }
}
```

Set up the StakingBonus contract, give him some ZERO balance.
Call setBonusBps with 1%, which should be 100 bps.
Call calculate bonus with a amount and watch it return the amount.
Set bonus to 100%. Watch calculate bonus become 100x the amount.

Run the test with the following command:
```shell
forge test --match-test test_pocStakingBonus -vvv
```
