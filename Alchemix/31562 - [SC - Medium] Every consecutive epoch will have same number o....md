Report ID: #31562

Report type: Smart Contract

Report severity: Medium

Target: https://github.com/alchemix-finance/alchemix-v2-dao/blob/main/src/Minter.sol

Impacts:
- Contract fails to deliver promised returns, but doesn't lose value

## Description
## Brief/Intro
```Minter``` contract have function ```updatePeriod``` where it has a condition where it reset ```stepdown``` to update ```rewards``` for next epoch.

## Vulnerability Details
The description for condition to reset ```stepdown``` in ```updatePeriod``` function clearly mentions only when the ```rewards``` level reached the ```TAIL_EMISSIONS_RATE```.
```
// Once we reach the emissions tail stepdown is 0

if (rewards <= TAIL_EMISSIONS_RATE) {
                stepdown = 0;
            }
``` 
However, the condition logic is flawed as it is designed to reset ```stepdown``` even when 
```rewards``` level is lower than the ```TAIL_EMISSIONS_RATE``` for the current epoch.
This will lead to resetting of ```stepdown``` in every coming epoch that will have ```less or equal``` rewards with comparison to ```TAIL_EMISSIONS_RATE```.
```
// Set rewards for next epoch
            rewards -= stepdown;
```
## Impact Details
When the ```updatePeriod``` is called at first epoch and if ```rewards``` level is lower /equal to ```TAIL_EMISSIONS_RATE``` it will reset ```stepdown```.

This will impact 3rd epoch, as when ```updatePeriod``` is called in 2nd epoch it will have ```stepdown``` value equal to ```0```. 
```
            rewards -= stepdown;
```
```rewards``` value for 3rd epoch will be same as the previous 2nd epoch value, as the call in 2nd epoch will have no impact on value of ```rewards``` based on condition of being subtracted with zero.

## Recommendation

Recommendation is made to change the logic from ```<=``` to ```>=``` to clearly and truely meet the condition of resetting ```stepdown```, only when ```rewards``` amount meets or surpassed the value of ```TAIL_EMISSIONS_RATE```.
```diff
    /// @inheritdoc IMinter
    function updatePeriod() external returns (uint256) {
        require(msg.sender == address(voter), "not voter");

        uint256 period = activePeriod;

        if (block.timestamp >= period + DURATION && initializer == address(0)) {
            // Only trigger if new epoch
            period = (block.timestamp / DURATION) * DURATION;
            activePeriod = period;
            epochEmissions = epochEmission();

            uint256 veAlcxEmissions = calculateEmissions(epochEmissions, veAlcxEmissionsRate);
            uint256 timeEmissions = calculateEmissions(epochEmissions, timeEmissionsRate);
            uint256 treasuryEmissions = calculateEmissions(epochEmissions, treasuryEmissionsRate);
            uint256 gaugeEmissions = epochEmissions.sub(veAlcxEmissions).sub(timeEmissions).sub(treasuryEmissions);
            uint256 balanceOf = alcx.balanceOf(address(this));

            if (balanceOf < epochEmissions) alcx.mint(address(this), epochEmissions - balanceOf);

            // Set rewards for next epoch
            rewards -= stepdown;

            // Adjust updated emissions total
            supply += rewards;

            // Once we reach the emissions tail stepdown is 0
-           if (rewards <= TAIL_EMISSIONS_RATE) {
+           if (rewards >= TAIL_EMISSIONS_RATE) {
                stepdown = 0;
            }

            // If there are no votes, send emissions to veALCX holders
            if (voter.totalWeight() > 0) {
                alcx.approve(address(voter), gaugeEmissions);
                voter.notifyRewardAmount(gaugeEmissions);
            } else {
                veAlcxEmissions += gaugeEmissions;
            }

            // Logic to distrubte minted tokens
            IERC20(address(alcx)).safeTransfer(address(rewardsDistributor), veAlcxEmissions);
            rewardsDistributor.checkpointToken(); // Checkpoint token balance that was just minted in rewards distributor
            rewardsDistributor.checkpointTotalSupply(); // Checkpoint supply

            IERC20(address(alcx)).safeTransfer(address(timeGauge), timeEmissions);
            timeGauge.notifyRewardAmount(timeEmissions);

            IERC20(address(alcx)).safeTransfer(treasury, treasuryEmissions);

            revenueHandler.checkpoint();

            emit Mint(msg.sender, epochEmissions, supply);
        }
        return period;
    }
}
```




## Proof of Concept
This test demonstrate the no change in impact in value of ```rewards``` for next epoch if its value is less or equal to ```TAIL_EMISSIONS_RATE``` in current one.
For this test values for variables are assumed to have clear idea on the outcome generated when the ```updatePeriod``` is called in 2nd epoch.
```
    uint256 TAIL_EMISSIONS_RATE = 2194; // ALCX tail emissions rate sans 18

    uint256 supply = 100; // assumed value of stepdown sans 18 decimals
    uint256 stepdown = 100; // assumed value of stepdown sans 18 decimals
    uint256 rewards = 2190; // assumed value of rewards sans 18 decimals

    // forge t --mt test_newEpoch -vv
    function test_newEpoch() external {
        console.log("Reward at 1st Epoch:", rewards);

        test_UpdatePeriod(); // call made for 1st epoch
        console.log("Stepdown:", stepdown);
console.log("Reward set for 2nd Epoch:", rewards);
        assertEq(rewards, 2090); // asserting reward set after function called

        uint256 next_EPOCH = 2 weeks; // assume update is called on 2nd week
        vm.warp(next_EPOCH); // making call to the function at new epoch i.e. 2nd week

        test_UpdatePeriod(); // call made for 2nd epoch
        console.log("Reward after UpdatePeriod() called on 2nd Epoch:", rewards); // Reward set for 3rd Epoch
        assertEq(rewards, 2090); // asserting reward set at 2nd Epoch

    }
 ```
The test passed when ```updatePeriod``` is called during 1st and 2nd epoch with same value of ```rewards``` generated each time.
```
[PASS] test_newEpoch() (gas: 23198)
Logs:
  Reward at 1st Epoch: 2190
  Stepdown: 0
  Reward set for 2nd Epoch: 2090
  Reward after UpdatePeriod() called on 2nd Epoch: 2090

Suite result: ok. 1 passed; 0 failed; 0 skipped; finished in 1.75ms (228.17µs CPU time)

Ran 1 test suite in 86.64ms (1.75ms CPU time): 1 tests passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped (1 total tests)
```

The value shown for ```rewards``` is same for 3rd epoch as it is subtracted to zero in the 2nd epoch one by meeting the condition of <= to ```TAIL_EMISSIONS_RATE```.
