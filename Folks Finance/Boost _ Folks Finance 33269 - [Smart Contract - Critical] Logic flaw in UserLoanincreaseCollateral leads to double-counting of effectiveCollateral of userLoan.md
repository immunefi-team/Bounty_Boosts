Report ID: #33269

Report type: Smart Contract

Report severity: Critical

Target: https://testnet.snowtrace.io/address/0xf8E94c5Da5f5F23b39399F6679b2eAb29FE3071e

Impacts:
- Direct theft of any user funds, whether at-rest or in-motion, other than unclaimed yield
- Protocol insolvency

## Description
## Summary 
Malicious users can call a deposit function with amount=0 to make  `increaseCollateral` pushes the same `poolId` into `colPools`, causing `getLoanLiquidity` to double-count the total collateral effective value of the loan.  

## Description
Users' loan position is stored in a mapping of a struct `UserLoan`
```
struct UserLoan {
    bool isActive;
    bytes32 accountId;
    uint16 loanTypeId;
    uint8[] colPools;
    uint8[] borPools;
    mapping(uint8 poolId => UserLoanCollateral) collaterals;
    mapping(uint8 poolId => UserLoanBorrow) borrows;
}
mapping(bytes32 loanId => UserLoan) internal _userLoans;
```
A member named `colPools` stores a list of `poolId` that users are using in their position.   
This is analogous to a list of markets user enters in other lending platforms.

This list is used in a calculation of users' effective collateral value.  
See: https://github.com/Folks-Finance/folks-finance-xchain-contracts/blob/main/contracts/hub/logic/UserLoanLogic.sol#L283-L291  
and https://github.com/Folks-Finance/folks-finance-xchain-contracts/blob/main/contracts/hub/logic/UserLoanLogic.sol#L230-L245
```
function isLoanOverCollateralized(
    LoanManagerState.UserLoan storage loan,
    mapping(uint8 poolId => IHubPool) storage pools,
    mapping(uint8 poolId => LoanManagerState.LoanPool) storage loanPools,
    IOracleManager oracleManager
) internal view returns (bool) {
    DataTypes.LoanLiquidityParams memory loanLiquidity = getLoanLiquidity(loan, pools, loanPools, oracleManager);
    return loanLiquidity.effectiveCollateralValue >= loanLiquidity.effectiveBorrowValue;
}
...
...
function getLoanLiquidity(
    LoanManagerState.UserLoan storage loan,
    mapping(uint8 => IHubPool) storage pools,
    mapping(uint8 => LoanManagerState.LoanPool) storage loanPools,
    IOracleManager oracleManager
) internal view returns (DataTypes.LoanLiquidityParams memory loanLiquidity) {
    // declare common variables
    uint256 effectiveValue;
    uint256 balance;
    uint8 poolId;
    uint256 poolsLength;
    DataTypes.PriceFeed memory priceFeed;

    // calc effective collateral value
    poolsLength = loan.colPools.length;
    for (uint8 i = 0; i < poolsLength; i++) {
        poolId = loan.colPools[i];

        balance = loan.collaterals[poolId].balance.toUnderlingAmount(
            pools[poolId].getUpdatedDepositInterestIndex()
        );
        priceFeed = oracleManager.processPriceFeed(poolId);
        effectiveValue += MathUtils.calcCollateralAssetLoanValue(
            balance,
            priceFeed.price,
            priceFeed.decimals,
            loanPools[poolId].collateralFactor
        );
    }
    loanLiquidity.effectiveCollateralValue = effectiveValue;
    ...snipped...
    ...snipped...
```
It iterates over `colPool` to get all `poolId` and uses them to retrieve current deposit balance of the loan for each pool

Below is the code snippet responsible for adding a new `poolId` to user's loan.  
See: https://github.com/Folks-Finance/folks-finance-xchain-contracts/blob/main/contracts/hub/logic/UserLoanLogic.sol#L20-L25
```
function increaseCollateral(LoanManagerState.UserLoan storage loan, uint8 poolId, uint256 fAmount) external {
    // if the balance was prev zero, add pool to list of user loan collaterals
    if (loan.collaterals[poolId].balance == 0) loan.colPools.push(poolId);

    loan.collaterals[poolId].balance += fAmount;
}
```
If the loan is currently holding 0 token, then it pushes a `poolId` into `colPools`.  
However, this logic is flawed because the deposit amount of `0` is allowed. (I presume, since there is no validation preventing it).  
See: https://github.com/Folks-Finance/folks-finance-xchain-contracts/blob/main/contracts/hub/LoanManager.sol#L74-L110
and https://github.com/Folks-Finance/folks-finance-xchain-contracts/blob/main/contracts/hub/logic/LoanManagerLogic.sol#L66-L151

Calling deposit function with amount=0 twice or more will cause `increaseCollateral` to push the same `poolId` into `colPools`.  
As a result, `getLoanLiquidity` will retrieve a duplicate of `poolId` and double or triple count the effective collateral value.  

## Impact
Adversaries can leverage double-counting (or more) to steal funds from the contract by borrowing more than their effective collateral value.  
        
## Proof of concept
## Proof-of-Concept
I modify a test in `LoanManager.test.ts` to demonstrate that calling deposit function with amount=0 will push the same `poolId` into `colPools`.  
I use `getUserLoan` to retrieve the current status of user's loan to show that `colPools` stores duplicates of `poolId`.  

**Note**: `getUserLoan` has the following interface:  
```
function getUserLoan(
    bytes32 loanId
) external view
returns (
    bytes32 accountId,
    uint16 loanTypeId,
    uint8[] memory colPools,
    uint8[] memory borPools,
    UserLoanCollateral[] memory,
    UserLoanBorrow[] memory
)
```

**Steps to reproduce** 
1. Set up a project as per protocol's **README**  
2. Create a new file name `DoubleCounting.test.ts` in `/test/hub/DoubleCounting.test.ts` with the code in this secret gist: https://gist.github.com/nnez/aa74df43103230004697438d4471c43f  
3. Run the test in the root of directory, `npx hardhat test test/hub/DoubleCounting.test.ts --grep "double-counting of collateral"`  

Expected result: 
```
