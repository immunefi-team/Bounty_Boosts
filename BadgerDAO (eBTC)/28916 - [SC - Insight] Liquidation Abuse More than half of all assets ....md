## Description
Liquidation Abuse: More than half of all assets can be liquidated in recovery mode.


## Brief/Intro
At the end of the grace period in recovery mode, the liquidator can maximize profits and cause enormous losses to the protocol.

## Vulnerability Details

![img_1.png](img_1.png)

The vulnerability is that in recovery mode, the liquidator can arbitrarily liquidate ICRs equal to or smaller than TCR.


When CDP with ICR smaller than TCR is liquidated, TCR rises.

In addition, TCR does not change when CDP with ICR such as TCR is completely liquidated.

In other words, the CDP with ICR close to TCR is liquidated, the slower the TCR rises, and if the system's recovery speed is very slow, the liquidated assets are eventually maximized.

Conversely, the smaller ICR is than TCR, the faster the system can enter the recovery phase, and the amount of liquidation is minimized.

These maximization and minimization principles have a significant impact on the amount of total assets held at the same time as the system transitions to normal mode, and the wave of total assets determines the system's stability (intensity) for future market fluctuations.

``
The distribution of collateral amount according to ICR is similar to one normal distribution chart in which the amount decreases as the distance to  TCR is centered on the TCR.
Of course, the real graph will draw a curve in which the right and left are not symmetrical to each other around TCR and the right is slower than the left.
What is important is that assets are concentrated and distributed around TCRs.
``

This means that the maximization of liquidation leads to the rapid liquidation of the system's main assets, and in the worst-case scenario, more than half of the total collateral can be eliminated in a tx.


In particular, when TCR reaches MCR, this maximization reaches its peak, and the attacker can liquidate all CDPs between  MCR and CCR. In the end, liquidation in recovery mode will deal a significant blow to the protocol and later bring about protocol bankruptcy, contrary to the initial purpose of maintaining the normal operation of the system by allowing liquidation in recovery mode to be allowed to recover quickly and improve the market situation.

Additionally, attempts to maximize liquidation lead to liquidation from a higher ICR to a lower one.
This goes against the general principle that CDPs with higher ICRs should be relatively safer than CDPs with lower ICRs, which leads to the destruction of community.

### Scenario for Liquidation Maximization Attack

Now the system is in recoveryMode and grace period is finished. 

1) The attacker searches CDPs (ICR = TCR).
2) The attacker liquidates the CDPs (ICR = TCR). => oldTCR = newTCR.
3) The attacker searches the largest CDP (ICR < TCR)
4) The attacker searches the smallest CDP (TCR < ICR < CCR). 
    And then the attacker calculates the debtAmount to make TCR to ICR of the found CDP.
5) The attacker liquidates the largest CDP (ICR < TCR) partially or fully until TCR reaches the desired ICR value.
6) If the liquidation of one CDP does not produce the desired TCR value, continue with the step 5.
7) Steps 1 through 6 are repeated until there is no CDP with an ICR greater than the TCR and less than the MCR.
8) Proceed to step 1 ~ step 6 until TCR reaches CCR - 1.
   Repeated steps 1, 2, 3, and 4 are due to the fact that partial liquidation of the CDP results in changes in ICR, so that the CDP may be larger than TCR and smaller than CCR.
9) Completely liquidate the CDP, which has the largest collateral amount among CDPs with ICRs smaller than TCRs.


As a result of this attack, all CDPs between the initial TCR and CCR are liquidated, and some CDPs with ICRs smaller than TCR are also completely and partially liquidated.

Let's look at this scenario through real code.

```
As can be seen from the code execution results, with the liquidation of the first CDP, we can return the system to normal mode and keep the system's holdings as much as possible.

However, the attacker liquidated all four CDPs in a maximization manner and made a quadruple profit, resulting in System losing 80% of its original assets.

Of course, the attacker will have to pay a small fee in the process of obtaining and repay again for debtToken because he uses a pool of several protocols such as balancer FlashLoan and uniswap dex to borrow debtToken, but if he calculates it well, a considerable amount of collateral can be liquidated and he would get much revenue.

Attached is a graph for intuitive understanding.
The collateral itself according to the actual ICR is close to a normal distribution, but not a complete normal distribution.

## Impact Details
As you can see, the attacker can maximize his or her profits by liquidating a significant number of CDPs through a maximization method rather than a minimization method.
As a result, the protocol's holdings will be seriously affected, and more than half of the total holdings may be liquidated in the worst-case scenario, despite the fact that it can go to normal mode while minimizing the reduction of the protocol's holdings.
This vicious cycle can deplete the protocol's assets, leading to the protocol's bankruptcy.

## References
To solve this vulnerability, we can simply check the TCR whenever the function proceeds with a CDP.

We can modify CdpManager.sol:393-395 lines like

```solidity
while (
    currentBorrower != address(0) && totals.remainingDebtToRedeem > 0 && getCachedTCR(totals.price) >= MCR
) {
```

### Scenario for Liquidation Maximization Attack

Now the system is in recoveryMode and grace period is finished. 

1) The attacker searches CDPs (ICR = TCR).
2) The attacker liquidates the CDPs (ICR = TCR). => oldTCR = newTCR.
3) The attacker searches the largest CDP (ICR < TCR)
4) The attacker searches the smallest CDP (TCR < ICR < CCR). 
    And then the attacker calculates the debtAmount to make TCR to ICR of the found CDP.
5) The attacker liquidates the largest CDP (ICR < TCR) partially or fully until TCR reaches the desired ICR value.
6) If the liquidation of one CDP does not produce the desired TCR value, continue with the step 5.
7) Steps 1 through 6 are repeated until there is no CDP with an ICR greater than the TCR and less than the MCR.
8) Proceed to step 1 ~ step 6 until TCR reaches CCR - 1.
   Repeated steps 1, 2, 3, and 4 are due to the fact that partial liquidation of the CDP results in changes in ICR, so that the CDP may be larger than TCR and smaller than CCR.
9) Completely liquidate the CDP, which has the largest collateral amount among CDPs with ICRs smaller than TCRs.


As a result of this attack, all CDPs between the initial TCR and CCR are liquidated, and some CDPs with ICRs smaller than TCR are also completely and partially liquidated.

Let's look at this scenario through real code.

You can create PoC_CdpManagerLiquidationRecoveryTest.t.sol file in foundry_test folder.

And run this in terminal.


`forge test -vvv --match-contract PoC_CdpManagerLiquidationRecoveryTest`.

```
As can be seen from the code execution results, with the liquidation of the first CDP, we can return the system to normal mode and keep the system's holdings as much as possible.

However, the attacker liquidated all four CDPs in a maximization manner and made a quadruple profit, resulting in System losing 80% of its original assets.

Of course, the attacker will have to pay a small fee in the process of obtaining and repay again for debtToken because he uses a pool of several protocols such as balancer FlashLoan and uniswap dex to borrow debtToken, but if he calculates it well, a considerable amount of collateral can be liquidated and he would get much revenue.

Attached is a graph for intuitive understanding.
The collateral itself according to the actual ICR is close to a normal distribution, but not a complete normal distribution.
